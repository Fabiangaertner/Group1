The "Group1" directory contains 
-the main Group1.proj file, which is the whole project we made for this exam. 
-the original exam description file 
-R markdown files, in both Rmd and html files. Here, we present what we did for the exam, including selected plots and .
-mit LICENSE file recommended by course leader 
-.gitignore file (related to github collaboration)
-.Rhistory
-Current README-file
-a txt-file with some extra notes to ourselves :) (Grundig_summary.txt) 


In the "Group1" > "DATA" directory:

-Two raw data files, abm_data_txt and exam_abm_joindata.txt, and the original codebook, codebook_exam_data.html

-We have tidied and wrangled the data and created a new tidy dataset, full_data_tidy_2024-09-12.txt. (we assume the full_data_tidy_2024-09-19.txt file is the exact same, and was created because we ran all our codes one last time, but were a bit scared to delete it...). 

-New updated codebook, codebook_new.txt.


In the "Group1" > "SCRIPTS" directory there are four scripts: 
1. Master_script.R is the first script, which was made by doing assignments individually in branches, and then merging the codes into the master file.

2. Script_join_data.R is the second script, consisting of both raw data files. The assignments in this script were performed by two group members cooperating in the same script (master)

3. scripts_plots.R with day 7 assignmnets was performed in one master branch, but there was cooperation and discussion within the whole group.

4. Analysis.R script is the final script, consisting analysis (day 8 assignments).This was also performed in one master branch, but there was cooperation and discussion within the whole group on which tests to perform and how.
